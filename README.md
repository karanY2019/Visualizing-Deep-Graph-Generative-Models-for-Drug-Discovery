# Visualizing-Deep-Graph-Generative-Models-for-Drug-Discovery
* Presented at 2020 KDD Workshop on Applied Data Science for Healthcare https://dshealthkdd.github.io/dshealth-2020/
### Abstract
* First, we propose a visualization framework
which provides interactive visualization tools to visualize molecules
generated during the encoding-and-decoding process of deep graph
generative models. Also, we provide real-time molecular optimization functionalities. 
* Second, we propose an end-to-end de novo drug
design approach to generate novel molecules with high binding affinity to a specific target protein. We have conducted some initial
experiments to leverage the power of MoFlow[11] (a generative
model) and the pre-trained drug-target binding affinity prediction
models from DeepPurpose[8]. Our work tries to empower black-box
AI-driven drug discovery models with some visual interpretive abilities. We believe our initial exploration of generating target-specific
novel drug molecules will provide valuable insights for AI-based
approaches to timely combat future unforeseen pandemics.
